# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Want to take a quiz? This is a great way to test your knowledge on coding, but you have a minute to win it! Your score is tallied at the end of the quiz and you can save your highscore. The twist is that for every wrong answer, your time is reduced. Now you have to race against the clock to get the highest score possible.

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
